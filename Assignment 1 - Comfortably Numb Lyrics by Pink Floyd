<h1>"Comfortably Numb" by Pink Floyd</h1>
<h2>
Hello<br>
Is there anybody in there?<br>
Just nod if you can hear me<br>
Is there anyone at home?<br>
<br>
Come on now<br>
I hear you're feeling down<br>
Well, I can ease your pain<br>
Get you on your feet again<br>
<br>
Relax<br>
I'll need some information first<br>
Just the basic facts<br>
Can you show me where it hurts?<br>
<br>
There is no pain, you are receding<br>
A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
You are only coming through in waves<br>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
When I was a child I had a fever<br>
My hands felt just like two balloons<br>
Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
I can't explain, you would not understand<br>
This is not how I am<br>
I have become comfortably numb<br>
<br>
I have become comfortably numb<br>
<br>
O.K.<br>
Just a little pin prick<br>
There'll be no more ah!<br>
But you may feel a little sick<br>
<br>
Can you stand up?<br>
I do believe it's working, good<br>
That'll keep you going through the show<br>
Come on, it's time to go<br>
<br>
There is no pain you are receding<br>
A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
You are only coming through in waves<br>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
When I was a child<br>
I caught a fleeting glimpse<br>
Out of the corner of my eye<br>
I turned to look but it was gone<br>
I cannot put my finger on it now<br>
The child is grown<br>
The dream is gone<br>
I have become comfortably numb<br>
